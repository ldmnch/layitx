    "text": "Hi! I’m Laia Domenech Burin, a sociologist and data scientist dedicated to leveraging data for societal impact. I hold a Licentiate in Sociology from the University of Buenos Aires and am pursuing a Master’s in Data Science for Public Policy at the Hertie School of Governance.\nMy experience spans roles in academia, consulting, and advocacy. I am currently working as a Research Assistant at the LMU Munich, in cool projects as extracting CO2 emissions from company reports and digitization of building plans for sustainability measures. I am also interested in the analysis of hate speech and its relationship to new right-wing parties. Find my CV here.\nAs an educator, I teach Introduction to R for Social Scientists with a critic perspective."
