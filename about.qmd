Hi! I'm Laia Domenech Burin, a sociologist and data scientist dedicated to leveraging data for societal impact. I hold a Licentiate in Sociology from the University of Buenos Aires and am pursuing a Master's in Data Science for Public Policy at the Hertie School of Governance.

My experience spans roles in academia, consulting, and advocacy. I am currently working as a Research Assistant at the LMU Munich, in cool projects as extracting CO2 emissions from company reports and digitization of building plans for sustainability measures. I am also interested in the analysis of hate speech and its relationship to new right-wing parties. Find my [CV here.](https://www.overleaf.com/read/zcngfwqxmczg#29b4ae)

As an educator, I teach Introduction to R for Social Scientists with a critic perspective.
